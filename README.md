Supply Chain Network Design and Profit Simulation
Overview

This project analyzes strategic supply chain decisions using a combination of network design optimization and Monte Carlo simulation. It addresses two core managerial problems:

optimal production network configuration under varying transportation costs, and

profit evaluation under uncertainty using stochastic inputs.

The analysis is implemented using Excel-based modeling and simulation, focusing on cost minimization, risk assessment, and decision sensitivity.

Part 1: Production Network Design (CoolWipes Case)

The network design problem evaluates where to open production lines for wipes and ointments across multiple regions to minimize total cost.

Key Decisions Analyzed

Plant location and line opening decisions

Allocation of regional demand to plants

Capacity utilization and excess capacity

Impact of transportation cost changes

Scenarios Evaluated

Base case network

Transportation costs halved

Transportation costs doubled

Network rebuilt from scratch without the Chicago plant

Key Insight

High-volume products justify decentralized production to reduce transportation costs, while low-volume products are optimally centralized to avoid unnecessary fixed investments.

Part 2: Monte Carlo Profit Simulation

A Monte Carlo simulation model evaluates supply chain profitability under uncertainty over a fixed planning horizon.

Stochastic Factors Included

Demand uncertainty

Part cost variability

Labour cost variability

Supplier failure probability

Defect rate and quality variation

Lead time delays

Exchange rate fluctuations

Sustainability-related costs and penalties

Each iteration computes revenue, total cost, and profit, generating a full profit distribution rather than a single-point estimate.

Key Results

Positive expected profit with controlled downside risk

Demand uncertainty is the strongest driver of profit variability

Supplier disruptions and cost volatility significantly impact outcomes

Sustainability-related factors have a moderate but meaningful financial effect

Business Value

Supports facility location and capacity planning decisions

Quantifies risk instead of relying on deterministic assumptions

Enables scenario planning and sensitivity analysis

Demonstrates integration of operations, finance, and sustainability considerations

Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Monte Carlo simulation

Optimization and scenario analysis
